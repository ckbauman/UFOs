# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
This project creates an interactive website for UFO data.  There is information about UFO sightings displayed in a table.  The table can be filtered to narrow down the table data by Date, City, State, Country and Shape.  One or many filters can be applied.


## Results
The UFO detail is listed in the Table selection at the bottom right of the page.  This will initially include all data with no filters.

Table date includes:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
- Duration
- Comments

INSERT: full screen

Filter Options are used to better limit the amount of data you would like to see at one time.  Filters are located on the bottom left of the screen.

Filter's Included are:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

INSERT: filter screen

You can filter on just one option, then hit ENTER.

Example for the "Date" filter:

INSERT: filter date

You can also select multiple filter options, hitting ENTER after each input.

Example for "Date" and "State" filters:

INSERT: filter date state

To go back to the original, full table dataset, go to the top of the page and REFRESH the screen.

INSERT: refresh


## Summary

This is a nice selection of UFO data.  One drawback is that there isn't an option to refresh the table data without refreshing the entire page.

Options for further development are:
1. Add a Table refresh option next to the filter options
2. Include some more visual options to reinforce the data, such as maps or charts.
